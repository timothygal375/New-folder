            <h2>2 Nephi 2:8</h2>
            <p>
                Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth;
                that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits,
                and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit,
                that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.

                Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door,
                I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
