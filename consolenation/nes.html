            <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System is one of the most iconic consoles of all time. Originally released in Japan in 1983 under the name Famicom (short for family computer), Nintendo was hesitant to release the console in America due to the crash in the video game industry that hit America hard in 1983. The market was oversaturated with subpar games, and consumers were tired of paying for a game and bringing it home, only to find that it was massively inferior to its arcade counterpart and/or was simply poorly designed, with confusing objectives and frustrating glitches. It seemed as if video games were to be relegated to arcades forever and removed from homes around America. With all this in mind, Nintendo decided to attempt to release the console in America anyway. Its graphics were comparable to those of many of the most popular arcade games of that period, and the popularity of those games seemed to prove that video games were not out just yet in America. Thus, Nintendo of America was given the daunting task of selling the Famicom to retailers nationwide. With the public’s aversity to video game consoles in mind, Nintendo of America designed the console to look more like a VCR than an Atari. Additionally, they included several peripherals with the console to make it look more like an expensive toy than a video game system. These peripherals included the light gun, used to shoot ducks in Duck Hunt, and ROB the robot, who would act almost like a second player in the games for which he was designed. Following a very successful test release in New York City, the Nintendo Entertainment System took the nation by storm, selling over 60 million units, and proving that home video games were still a viable source of revenue. 
                The NES didn’t have much competition for most of its life. Atari took a stab at the home console market again with their 7200 model, and Sega tried to get a piece of the pie as well with their Master System. However, neither was nearly as popular as the NES, which became the undisputed king of the 8-bit era of home consoles.
