        The purpose of this website is to provide an environment wherein people can learn more about the history of gaming, specifically the backstory behind some of the most iconic consoles and games of all time. People may wonder about the specific dates that these things released, their surprisingly widespread impact on society, the intriguing stories of how they came about, the innovative spirits of those that created them, some of their key features, how they functioned, etc. No other site will provide as detailed information as pertaining to the aforementioned topics.

        We may as well begin by addressing one of the most iconic consoles of all time: the Nintendo Entertainment System. Originally released in Japan in 1983 under the name Famicom (short for family computer), Nintendo was hesitant to release the console in America due to the crash in the video game industry that hit America hard in 1983. The market was oversaturated with subpar games, and consumers were tired of paying for a game and bringing it home, only to find that it was massively inferior to its arcade counterpart and/or was simply poorly designed, with confusing objectives and frustrating glitches. It seemed as if video games were to be relegated to arcades forever and removed from homes around America. With all this in mind, Nintendo decided to attempt to release the console in America anyway. Its graphics were comparable to those of many of the most popular arcade games of that period, and the popularity of those games seemed to prove that video games were not out just yet in America. Thus, Nintendo of America was given the daunting task of selling the Famicom to retailers nationwide. With the public’s aversity to video game consoles in mind, Nintendo of America designed the console to look more like a VCR than an Atari. Additionally, they included several peripherals with the console to make it look more like an expensive toy than a video game system. These peripherals included the light gun, used to shoot ducks in Duck Hunt, and ROB the robot, who would act almost like a second player in the games for which he was designed. Following a very successful test release in New York City, the Nintendo Entertainment System took the nation by storm, selling over 60 million units, and proving that home video games were still a viable source of revenue. 
	However, the thing that comes to most people’s mind when it comes to the NES is the games that were released for the system. One of the most iconic video games released for the NES; indeed, one of the most iconic video games of all time was Super Mario Bros. One of the best-selling games of all time, Nintendo sold over 40 million copies. Super Mario Bros introduced the world to the concept of the side-scrolling 2D platformer, a genre that became extremely common around this period, with other games on the NES such as Super Mario Bros’s two sequels, the Mega Man series, the Castlevania series, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Kirby’s Adventure, and many more. 
	Another quality of the NES that made it popular was its competence when it came to emulating the games that were popular in the arcades at that time. Games such as Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Galaga, Pac-Man, and others. The concept of playing these games at one’s leisure rather than going to the arcade with an obscene number of quarters made these games very successful. 
	The NES didn’t have much competition for most of its life. Atari took a stab at the home console market again with their 7200 model, and Sega tried to get a piece of the pie as well with their Master System. However, neither was nearly as popular as the NES, which became the undisputed king of the 8-bit era of home consoles.

        Moving on to the 16-bit era, the first 16-bit console ever released was called the Turbo Grafx-16 in North America and the PC Engine everywhere else. Although it had much better graphics than its competitors at the time, it didn’t do nearly as well as the NES. The next major player in the 16-bit era was the Sega Genesis, released in 1988 in Japan and 1989 in North America. Following the disappointing performance of the Master System, Sega utilized an aggressive marketing campaign, demonstrating how the Sega Genesis was much more powerful than the NES. Nintendo took a couple of years to retaliate, during which time Sega managed to get a decent amount of market share. Nintendo’s 16-bit console was called the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, which boasted superior graphics to any of its competitors, with a price tag to go with it. Sega and Nintendo continued to battle for their share of the market, ending up with comparable sales numbers, around 40-50 million units each. 
	The Super Nintendo’s library was mostly an upgrade of the library of the NES, with titles like Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Super Punch-Out, Contra III, Mega Man X, Super Castlevania IV, and many more.
